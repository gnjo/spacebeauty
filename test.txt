Once you create a document in Microsoft Word, you can split it into separate documents within the Word file. These are called subdocuments. It is even possible to split one subdocument into multiple subdocuments. Splitting a Word document into multiple subdocuments requires the use of commands that are likely not immediately available once you open the file. You need to open a couple of more toolbars in the program to locate the commands you need.
